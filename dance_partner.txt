[00:01] And now we're dancing alone, I feel the world stop
[00:05] And when nobody else in sight I can finally say
[00:09] That you've been on my mind from the second we met
[00:12] I swear my heart skips a beat every time that we text
[00:16] Is this love? I feel like this all in my head?
[00:20] But, darling, take my hand and let's dance the night away
[00:26] Let's dance the night and night away Just you and I, just you and I
[00:32] And while we dance, I'll grab your hand
[00:35] I know I see it in your eyes and I see it in mine
[00:39] Now were in love (In love)
[00:41] The two of us (The two, the two)
[00:44] So, baby, trust me give it time
